# Mission-to-Mars

THe purpose of this module was to find images of mars hemispheres online and scrape websites to project onto a web app. Beautiful Soup and Splinter were used to scrape the images and stored on a Mongo database which was then uploaded onto a web app.

This challenge was not completed to the fullest due to pyMongo and flask not working properly. Multiple attempts of installation were tried through VS Code and through jupyter notebook. It was not working. This was the limit of the code that could be produced.
